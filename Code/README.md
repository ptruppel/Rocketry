# Description

Integrate INU Data is made to analyze the data collected from Arduino gryoscope and acceleration sensors. In particular, this is made to work alongside the Adafruit BNO055 sensor.

The Bearing Stress Updated code is made to determine the stresses on a bolt and the hole it goes into. This was created to determine the stresses in an engine mount. 

The Gyroscope and Acceleration code can be used on an Arduino to record and save the data coming off of Adafruit sensors. A data logging shield is needed for this purpose.
