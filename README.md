# Rocketry

This is an aggregate repository of all the work I have done on rocketry design teams and projects. 

## Getting Started

Open up MATLAB and Arduino and simply run the codes for analysis and data collection. The MATLAB codes are for analysis while the Arduino codes are for data collection. Modify the code's inputs as needed. The parts on this repository are built in Solidworks, so opening solid works and loading them into that will be necessary to view them. 

### Prerequisites

MATLAB license, Arduino download, and Solidworks license. 

## Built With

* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - The coding environment used for analysis
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - The coding environment used for data collection
